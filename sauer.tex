\section{Two equivalent frameworks}\label{vc_dimension}

Let $\U$ and $\V$ be two sets and let $\phi\subseteq \U\times\V$.
In other words $\phi$ is a \emph{bipartite graph}.
We may call $\phi$ an (abstract) \emph{incidence relation\/} and write $\phi(x,y)$ for $\<x,y\>\in\phi$.
Sets of the form

\ceq{\hfill\emph{$\phi(\U,b)$}}{=}{\{a\in\U:\phi(a,b)\}.}

are called \emph{definable sets\/} or, when more that a relation is involved, \emph{$\phi$-definable sets}.
The collection \emph{collection definable subsets\/} is denoted by \emph{$\phi(\U,b)_{b\in\V}$}.

Often we need to consider the \emph{trace\/} of a definable set on some arbitrary $A\subseteq\U$.

\ceq{\hfill\emph{$\phi(A,b)$}}{=}{\{a\in A:\phi(a,b)\}.}

We call this a \emph{definable subset of $A$}.
And denote by \emph{$\phi(A,b)_{b\in\V}$\/} the collection of definable subsets on $A$.

If all subsets of $A$ are definable, that is $\P A=\phi(A,b)_{b\in\V}$, we say that $A$ is \emph{shattered\/} by $\phi$.
The following is called the \emph{shatter function\/}

%\ceq{\hfill\emph{$\pi_\phi(n)$}}{=}{\max\Big\{|\phi(A,b)_{b\in\V}|\ \ :\ \ A\subseteq\U,\ |A|=n\Big\}.}

\ceq{\hfill\emph{$\pi_\phi(n)$}}{=}{\max\bigg\{|\phi(A,b)_{b\in\V}|\ \ :\ \ A\in {\U\choose n}\bigg\}.}

So, $\pi_\phi(n)$ gives the maximal number of definable subsets that a set of cardinality $n$ may have.
Trivially, $\pi_\phi(n)\le2^n$ for all $n$.
Moreover, if $\pi_\phi(k)=2^k$ for some $k$, then $\pi_\phi(n)=2^n$ for every $n\le k$.

Given $A\subseteq\U$ define the equivalence relation $\equiv_{\phi,A}$ defined by 

\ceq{\hfill\emph{$b\equiv_{\phi,A} b'$}}{\IFF}{\phi(a,b)\iff\phi(a,b')}\quad for ll $a\in A$;

\ceq{}{\IFF}{\phi(A,b)=\phi(A,b').}

We denote by $S_\phi(A)$ the set of $\equiv_{\phi,A}$-equivalence classes. We obviously have

\ceq{\hfill\pi_\phi(n)}{=}{\max\bigg\{|S_\phi(A)|\ \ :\ \  A\in {\U\choose n}\bigg\}.}

The dual incidence relation $\phi^*$ is the relation on $\V\times\U$ which is sometimes denoted by $\phi^{-1}$.
Then dual scattering function is defined as follows (with the obvious meaning of the notation) 

\ceq{\hfill\emph{$\pi^*_\phi(n)$}}{=}{\max\bigg\{|\phi(a,B)_{a\in\U}|\ \ :\ \ B\in {\V\choose n}\bigg\}.}

\begin{definition}\label{def_VCdim}
The \emph{Vapnik-Cher\-vo\-nen\-kis dimension\/} of $\phi$, abbreviated by \emph{\vc-dimension}, is the maximal cardinality of a finite set $A\subseteq\U$ that is shattered by $\phi$.
Equivalently, it is the maximal $k$ such that $\pi_\phi(k)=2^k$.
If such a maximum does not exist,
we say that $\phi$ has infinite \vc-dimension.

We will say \emph{dual \vc-dimension\/} for the \vc-dimension of $\phi^*$.

The \emph{\vc-density\/} of $\phi$ is the infimum over all real number $r$ such that $\pi_\phi(n)\in O(n^r)$.
It is infinite if no such $r$ exist.
The  \emph{dual \vc-density\/} is defined accordingly.\QED
\end{definition}


Then if the \vc-density is finite so is the \vc-dimension.
The converse is also true.
In fact, in the next section we show that the \vc-dimension bounds the \vc-density.

\begin{proposition}
If $\phi$ has \vc-dimension $< k$ then its dual \vc-dimension is $< 2^{k+1}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Assume that the \vc-dimension of $\phi^*$ is $\ge 2^k$.
We prove that the \vc-dimension of $\phi^*$ is $\ge k$.
Let $B=\{b_I\,:\,I\subseteq k\}$ be a set of cardinality $2^k$ shattered by $\phi^*$. 
That is, for every $\J\subseteq \P(k)$ there is $a_\J$ such that

\ceq{\hfill\phi(a_\J, b_I)}{\IFF}{I\in\J}

Let $a_i=a_{\{I\subseteq k\,:\, i\in I\}}$. Then from the equivalence above we obtain

\ceq{\hfill\phi(a_i, b_I)}{\IFF}{i\in I}

That is, $\phi$ shatters $\{a_i\,:\,i<k\}$.
\end{proof}

An alternative formalism uses \emph{set systems\/} in place of incidence relations.
A set system is a collection $\Phi$ of subsets of some set $\U$.
We denote a set system by $(\U,\Phi)$.
Given a set system, we immediately obtain an incidence relation with $\V=\P(\U)$ by defining $\phi(x,y)$ as $x\in y\in\Phi$.

Vice versa, to an incidence relation $\phi$ we associate $\Phi=\phi(\U,b)_{b\in\V}$, the set system of the definable subsets of $\U$.
%The non triviality assumption above translates to the claim that $\Phi$ contains at least two elements and $\Phi\neq\{\0,U\}$.
The \emph{\vc-dimension of $\Phi$} is defined to be that of the associated incidence relation.
The shatter function \emph{$\pi_\Phi(n)$\/} is defined in a similar way.

An incidence relation is \emph{extensional\/} if $\phi(\U,b')=\phi(\U,b'')$ implies $b',b''\in\V$.
The correspondence between extensional incidence relations and set systems is one-to-one.
In general, the correspondence is many-to-one.
However, as we are mainly interested the set system associated, we my switch from one formalism to the other according to which one is more convenient.

%An incidence relation is \emph{reduced\/} if $\phi(\U,b')=\phi(\U,b'')$ implies $b'=b''$ and, dually, $\phi(a',V)=\phi(a'',V)$ implies $a'=a''$.
%By quotienting and taking representatives, we can always find a reduced relation with the same shattering function.

\begin{example}\label{ex_vcdim}
\begin{itemize}
\item[a.] Set systems of cardinality $1$ are those with an incidence relation of the form $A\times\V$ for some $A\subseteq\U$.
They shatter only the empty set, therefore they have \vc-dimension $0$.
Their shatter function is identically $1$.
\item[b.] Let $\Phi$ be a non trivial partition of $\U$.
Then only singletons are shattered, so the \vc-dimension is $1$.
The shatter function is $\pi_\Phi(n)=\min\big\{n,|\Phi|\big\}$.
\item[c.] If $\Phi$ is a non trivial chain of subsets of $\U$ the situation is identical to that described in \ssf{b}.
\item[d.] Let $\U=\RR$ and let $\Phi$ be the collection of open intervals.
Any set of 2 points is shattered but no set with 3 points can.
So the \vc-dimension is $2$.
\item[e.] Let $\U=\RR^2$ and let $\Phi$ be the collection of half planes.
Any set of 3 non collinear points is shattered but no set with 4 points can (by Radon's Theorem).
So the \vc-dimension is $3$.
\item[f.] Let $\Phi=U^{[\le k]}$ be the collection of all subsets of $\U$ of cardinality $\le k$.
Then $\Phi$ has \vc-dimension $k$ and

\noindent\kern19ex$\displaystyle\pi_\Phi(n)=\sum^k_{i=0} \binom{n}{i}$.

%Consider the type space $S_{\phi^*}(B)$ where $B\subseteq\V$ is a set of cardinality $k$. Note that for every 

\item[g.] Let $\U=\RR^2$ and let $\Phi$ be the collection of polygons.
Then $\Phi$ has \vc-dimension $\infty$.\QED
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\section{The Sauer-Shelah Lemma}

According to Gil Kalai in~\cite{kalai}, Sauer-Shelah's Lemma can been described as an \textit{eigentheorem\/} because it is important in many different areas of mathematic (model theory, learning theory, probability theory, ergodic theory, Banach spaces, to name a few).
No wonder it has been discovered and rediscovered may times.

It has been proved independently by Shelah~\cite{shelah72}, Sauer~\cite{sauer}, and Vapnik-Cher\-vo\-nen\-kis~\cite{VC} around 1970 (Shelah gives credit to Micha Perles).
Saharon Shelah was working in model theory while Norbert Sauer, Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis were in statistical learning theory.

We shall present three proofs of this lemma, one in this section and two in the next section. I am aware of a forth proof which uses linear algebra, see e.g.~\cite{gowers}. 

\begin{proposition}[(Sauer-Shelah's Lemma)]\label{prop_Sauer}
If $\phi$ has \vc-dimension $k$ then for every $n\ge k$

\ceq{\hfill\pi_\phi(n)}{\le}{\bigsum^{k}_{i=0} \binom{n}{i}.} 
\end{proposition}

The set system presented in \ssf{f} of Example~\ref{ex_vcdim} shows that the bound is optimal.

\begin{proof}
If $k=0$, both sides of the inequality are $1$.
Now, assume the lemma is true for $k-1$.
We prove by induction on $n$ that for every $A$ of cardinality $n$

\ceq{\hfill\big|\phi(A,b)_{b\in\V}\big| }{\le}{\bigsum^{k}_{i=0} \binom{n}{i}.} 

If $n=k$ the r.h.s.\@ of the inequality above is $2^n$ and the claim is trivial.
So, assume the claim is true for $n-1$ and let $A$ have cardinality $n$.
Fix some $a\in A$ and let $A'=A\sm\{a\}$.
We can assume that $\phi(A,b)\simdiff\phi(A,b')=\{a\}$ for some $b,b'$, otherwise $\big|\phi(A,b)_{b\in\V}\big|=\big|\phi(A',b)_{b\in\V}\big|$ and the claim follows immediately from the induction hypothesis.

Define a new incidence relation

\ceq{\hfill\psi(x,y)}{=}{x\in A'\ \wedge\ \phi(x,y)\ \wedge\ \E y'\, \Big[\phi(A,y)\simdiff\phi(A,y')=\{a\}\Big].}

%\ceq{\hfill\psi(x,y)}{=}{\phi(x,y)\ \wedge\ \E y'\, \Big[\phi(A,y')\sm\phi(A,y)=\{a\}\Big].}

Note that if $A''$ is shattered by $\psi$ then $A''\cup\{a\}$ it is shattered by $\phi$.
Then the \vc-dimension of $\psi$ is at most $k-1$.
We also have that

\ceq{\hfill\big|\phi(A,b)_{b\in\V}\big|}{=}{\big|\phi(A',b)_{b\in\V}\big|\ +\ \big|\psi(A',b)_{b\in\V}\big|.}

Hence by induction hypothesis

\ceq{\hfill \big|\phi(A,b)_{b\in\V}\big|}{\le}{\bigsum^{k}_{i=0} \binom{n-1}{i}\ \  +\ \  \bigsum^{k-1}_{i=0}  \binom{n-1}{i}}

\ceq{}{=}{\binom{n-1}{0}\ \ +\ \ \bigsum^{k}_{i=1}\ \bigg[ \binom{n-1}{i}\ +\ \binom{n-1}{i-1}\bigg]}

\ceq{}{=}{\binom{n-1}{0}\ \ +\ \ \bigsum^{k}_{i=1}\ \ \binom{n}{i}}

\ceq{}{\le}{\bigsum^{k}_{i=0} \binom{n}{i}}

which completes the proof of the proposition.
\end{proof}

Next corollary states an important dichotomy.
It says that the shatter function grows exponentially unless the \vc-dimension is finite.
In this case the growth is only polynomial.
Therefore the \vc-dimension is an upper bond to the \vc-density.

\begin{corollary}\label{coroll_Sauer}
For every incidence relation $\phi$ one of the following obtains
\begin{itemize}
 \item[1.] the \vc-dimension is infinite and $\pi_\phi(n)=2^n$ for every positive integer $n$;
 \item[2.] the \vc-dimension is $k$ and $\pi_\phi(n)\ \in\ O(n^k)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
If \vc-dimension is infinite claim \ssf{1} is obvious.
So assume $\phi$ has \vc-dimension is $k$.
Then

\ceq{\hfill \pi_\phi(n)}{\le}{\bigsum^k_{i=0}\binom{n}{i}}\medrel{\le}$\displaystyle\bigsum^k_{i=0}\frac{n^i}{i!}\medrel{\le}e\,n^k$%\bigg(\frac{e\,n}{k}\bigg)^k$.
\end{proof}

\section{Pajor variant and the method of shifting}

An alternative proof of the Sauer-Shelah's Lemma derives it as corollary of a lemma by Alain Pajor~\cite{pajor}.
The proof below is credited to Noga Alon by Kalai~\cite{kalai}, to (many) others by~\cite{ARS}.

\begin{proposition}[(Pajor's Lemma)]\label{prop_Pajor}
Assume $\Phi$ is finite.
Then $\Phi$ there are at least $|\Phi|$ sets shattered by $\Phi$.
\end{proposition}

We show how Sauer-Shelah's Lemma follows from Pajor's Lemma.
Fix a set $A\subseteq\U$ of cardinality $n$ such that $\pi_\phi(n)=\big|\phi(A,b)_{b\in\V}\big|$.
Now, consider the set system $\Phi=\phi(A,b)_{b\in\V}$.
By Pajor's Lemma there are $|\Phi|$ subsets of $\U$ shattered by $\Phi$.
These subsets cannot have cardinality larger than the \vc-dimension of $\phi$, then $\Phi\subseteq A^{[\le k]}$

\ceq{\hfill\pi_\phi(n)}{=}{|\Phi|\medrel{\le}\big|A^{[\le k]}\big|\medrel{=}\sum^k_{i=0} \binom{n}{i}.}

\begin{proof}
The proposition holds if $|\Phi|=1$.
Now, suppose it holds for set systems of cardinality $<|\Phi|$.
Fix $a\in\U$ and let $\Phi_0=\big\{B\in\Phi : a\notin B\big\}$ and $\Phi_1=\Phi\sm\Phi_0$.
We can choose $a$ such that $\Phi_i\neq\Phi$.
By the inductive hypothesis, both $\Phi_i$ shatter at least $\big|\Phi_i\big|$ sets.
If no set is shattered by both $\Phi_i$, the claim follows immediately.
Otherwise, note that for each set shattered by both $\Phi_i$ there are two sets shattered by $\Phi$, one containing $a$ and one not containing $a$.
The claim follows.
\end{proof}
 
We give a second proof of Pajor's Lemma by a method which is interesting in itself because of its many applications.
I would not know whom to credit with this proof.
The method has been introduced by Erd\H{o}s, Ko and Rado to prove their eponymous theorem.
They named it \textit{compression}, but is now known as \textit{shifting}.


When $A'\subseteq A$ and $A\sm A'=\{a\}$, we write \emph{$A'\subseteq_{a}\kern-1.5pt A$}. We write

\ceq{\hfill\emph{$B_{\phi,a}$}}{=}{\big\{b\ :\ \phi(a,b)\ {\rm and}\ \neg\E b'\,\phi(\U,b')\subseteq_a\phi(\U,b)\big\}}

We say that $\phi$ is \emph{compressed\/} if $B_{\phi,a}=\0$ for every $a\in\U$.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop_compressed} 
If $\phi$ is compressed then any co-finite subset of a definable set is definable.
In particular $\phi$ shatters every finite subset of a definable set.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
If for contradiction $\psi(\U,b)\sm\{a\}$ is not definable, then $b\in B_{\phi,a}$.
\end{proof}


\begin{proposition}\label{prop_conservative} Let $\psi=\phi\sm\{a\}{\times}B_{\phi,a}$.
Then

\ceq{\hfill\psi(\U,b)=\psi(\U,b')}{\IFF}{\phi(\U,b)=\phi(\U,b')}\hfill for all $b,b'\in\V$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
$\IMP$\quad Assume $\phi(\U,b)\neq\phi(\U,b')$.
We may also assume that $\phi(\U\sm\{a\},b)=\phi(\U\sm\{a\},b')$, otherwise $\psi(\U,b)\neq\psi(\U,b')$ is immediate.
Then $\phi(a,b)\niff\phi(a,b')$, say $ \phi(a,b)$ and $\neg \phi(a,b')$.
Then $\phi(\U,b')\subseteq_a\phi(\U,b)$ and $b\notin B_{\phi,a}$.
So $\psi(a,b)$ and $\neg \psi(a,b')$.

$\PMI$\quad Assume $\psi(\U,b)\neq\psi(\U,b')$. 
Again, we may also assume that $\psi(\U\sm\{a\},b)=\psi(\U\sm\{a\},b')$.
Then $\psi(a,b)\niff\psi(a,b')$, say $\psi(a,b)$ and $\neg\psi(a,b')$.
As $\phi(a,b)$ is clear, we only have to prove that $\neg\phi(a,b')$.
Suppose for a contradiction that $\phi(a,b')$.
Then $b'\in B_{\phi,a}$.
This is a contradiction as $\psi(\U,b)\subseteq_a\psi(\U,b')$.
\end{proof}


\begin{proposition}\label{prop_shattered} 
Let $\psi=\phi\sm\{a\}{\times}B_{\phi,a}$.
Then every set shattered by $\psi$ is shattered by $\phi$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Assume $A$ is shattered by $\psi$.
We prove that for every $b$ here is a $b'$ such that $\psi(A,b)=\phi(A,b')$.
We may assume that $a\in A$.
If $\psi(a,b)$ then we may chose $b=b'$.
So, assume $\neg\psi(a,b)$.
As $\psi$ shatters $A$ then there is $c$ such that $\psi(A,c)=\psi(A,b)\cup\{a\}$.
Then $\E b'\,\phi(\U,b')\subseteq_a\phi(\U,c)$.
Therefore $\psi(A,b)=\phi(A,b')$.
\end{proof}


\begin{void_thm}[Second proof of Pajor's Lemma]\label{proof2_Pajor}\rm
Let $\phi$ be the incidence relation associated to $\Phi$.
We may assume that $\phi$ is finite.
Let $\phi_0=\phi$ and $\phi_{i+1}=\phi_i\sm \{a\}{\times}B_{\phi_i,a}$ for some $a$.
As $\phi$ is finite, we can assume that at some stage $n$ we obtain a compressed relation $\psi=\phi_n$.
Let $\Psi$ be the set of $\psi$-definable sets.
By Proposition~\ref{prop_shattered}, $\Psi$ shatters at least $|\Psi|$ sets.
By Proposition~\ref{prop_compressed}, every set shattered by $\Psi$ is shattered by $\Phi$.
By Proposition~\ref{prop_conservative}, $|\Psi|=|\Phi|$.\QED
\end{void_thm}

Define $E_{\phi,a}\subseteq\V^2$ as the set of e pairs $\<b',b\>$ such that $\phi(\U,b')\subseteq_a\phi(\U,b)$. 
Note incidentally that $E_{\phi,a}$ is the graph of a partial injections of $\V$ into itself. 

\begin{proposition}\label{prop_udd1} 
Let $\psi=\phi\sm\{a\}{\times}B_{\phi,a}$. Then $E_\phi\subseteq E_{\psi}$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}Both the range and the domain of $E_{\phi,a}$ are disjoint from $B_{\phi,a}$.
\end{proof}

We call $\displaystyle E_\phi=\bigcup_{a\in U}E_{\phi,a}$ the unit distance diagraph of $\phi$. 

\begin{proposition}
Let $\phi$ be a finite incidence relation with \vc-dimension $k$.
Let $\Phi$ be the set system associated to it. 
Then $|E_\phi|\le k\,|\Phi|$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $\psi$ and $\Psi$ be as defined in Proof~\ref{proof2_Pajor}.
By Propositions~\ref{prop_compressed} and~\ref{prop_shattered}, every has at most $k$ ancestors.
Therefore

\ceq{\hfill\frac{|E_\phi|}{|\Phi|}}{\le}{\frac{|E_\psi|}{|\Psi|}\medrel{\le}k}
\end{proof}

\begin{comment}
For $a\in\U$ and $B\in\Phi$ we define

\ceq{\hfill s_{a,\Phi}(B)}{=}%
{\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
B\sm\{a\} &{\rm if}\ a\in B\ {\rm and}\ B\sm\{a\}\notin\Phi\\
B &{\rm otherwise}\\
\end{array}\right.}

We write $s_a(\Phi)=\{s_{a,\Phi}(B) : B\in\Phi\}$.
We can think of $s_a(\Phi)$ as obtained by replacing $B$ with $B\sm\{a\}$ unless $\Phi$ already contains $B\sm\{a\}$.
This makes the function $s_a$ injective, hence $|s_a(\Phi)|=|\Phi|$.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop_shift_shatter}
If $A$ is shattered by $s_a(\Phi)$ then $A$ is also shattered by $\Phi$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We prove that for every $B\in\Phi$ there is $C\in\Phi$ such that $A\cap s_{a,\Phi}(B)=A\cap C$.
We can assume that $a\in B$ and $s_{a,\Phi}(B)=B\sm\{a\}$, otherwise $C=B$.
Assume also that $a\in A$, otherwise again $C=B$ will do.
As $A$ is shattered by $s_a(\Phi)$, there is a $B'$ such that $A\cap s_{a,\Phi}(B')=A\cap B$.
Hence $a\in s_{a,\Phi}(B')=B'$.
By the definition of $s_a$, it must be that $B'\sm\{a\}\in\Phi$, otherwise $B'$ would have been replaced by $B'\sm\{a\}$.
So $C=B'\sm\{a\}$ proves the proposition.
\end{proof}

%Note that $s_a\cdot s_b=s_b\cdot s_a$.

\begin{exercise}
Let $\Phi_{\cap A}=\{B\cap A: B\in\Phi\}$.
Prove that  $s_a(\Phi)_{\cap A}\subseteq s_a(\Phi_{\cap A})$.
Derive Proposition~\ref{prop_shift_shatter} from this fact.\QED
\end{exercise}

\begin{void_thm}[Second proof of Pajor's Lemma]\label{proof2_Pajor}\rm
As $\Phi$ is finite we can assume $\U$ is finite.
Let $\Psi$ be the result of applying $s_a$ to $\Phi$ for all $a\in\U$.
From the discussion above it is clear that $|\Psi|=|\Phi|$ and that sets shattered by $\Psi$ are also shattered by $\Phi$.
We claim that if $A\subseteq B\in \Psi$ then $A\in \Psi$.
Note that this implies that all sets in $\Psi$ are shattered by $\Psi$, hence by $\Phi$.
So the proposition follows from the claim.
If the claim fails, there is a $B\in\Psi$ such that $B\sm\{a\}\notin\Psi$.
But this is not possible because $s_{a,\Phi}(B)=B\sm\{a\}$.\QED
\end{void_thm}


Given two incidence relations $\psi$ and $\phi$ we shall consider the following properties. 

\ceq{\#\hfill\psi(\U,b)=\psi(\U,b')}{\IMP}{\phi(\U,b)=\phi(\U,b')}\hfill for all $b,b'\in\V$.

\ceq{\#\#\hfill\psi(\U,b)=\psi(\U,b')}{\IFF}{\phi(\U,b)=\phi(\U,b')}\hfill for all $b,b'\in\V$.

\begin{proposition} 
Fix $\phi$ and let $\psi$ be minimal (w.r.t.\@ inclusion) among the relations that satisfy \ssf{\#}.
Then every subset of a $\psi$-definable set is $\psi$-definable.
The same holds with \ssf{\#\#} for \ssf{\#}.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Suppose for contradiction that $\psi(\U,b)\sm A'$ is not definable for some $A'\neq\0$.
Then $\psi'=\psi\sm A'{\times}\{b\}$ satisfies \ssf{\#} contradicting the minimality of $\psi$. The proof for \ssf{\#\#} is similar.
\end{proof}

%When $\psi\subseteq\phi$ and $\phi\sm\psi=\{\<a,b\>\}$, we write \emph{$\psi\subseteq_{\<a,b\>}\kern-1.5pt\phi$}.

When $A'\subseteq A$ and $A\sm A'=\{a\}$, we write \emph{$A'\subseteq_{a}\kern-1.5pt A$}.

\begin{proposition} Let $\psi=\phi\sm\{a\}{\times}B_{\phi,a}$ where

\ceq{\hfill B_{\phi,a}}{=}{\big\{b\ : \neg\E b'\,\phi(\U,b')\subseteq_a\phi(\U,b)\big\}}

Then $\psi$ satisfy \ssf{\#\#}.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
$\IMP$\quad Assume $\phi(\U,b)\neq\phi(\U,b')$. 
We may also assume that $\phi(\U\sm\{a\},b)=\phi(\U\sm\{a\},b')$, otherwise $\psi(\U,b)\neq\psi(\U,b')$ is immediate.
Then $\phi(a,b)\niff\phi(a,b')$, say $ \phi(a,b)$ and $\neg \phi(a,b')$.
Then $\phi(\U,b')\subseteq_a\phi(\U,b)$ and $b\notin B_{\phi,a}$.
So $\psi(a,b)$ and $\neg \psi(a,b')$.

$\PMI$\quad Assume $\psi(\U,b)\neq\psi(\U,b')$. 
Again, we may also assume that $\psi(\U\sm\{a\},b)=\psi(\U\sm\{a\},b')$.
Then $\psi(a,b)\niff\psi(a,b')$, say $\psi(a,b)$ and $\neg\psi(a,b')$.
As $\phi(a,b)$ is clear, we only have to prove that $\neg\phi(a,b')$. 
Suppose for a contradiction that $\phi(a,b')$. 
Then $b'\in B_{\phi,a}$.
This is a contradiction as $\psi(\U,b)\subseteq_a\psi(\U,b')$.
\end{proof}




This $\psi$ will be constructed by stages.
That is, we define inductively $\phi_0,\dots,\phi_n$.
We let $\phi_0=\phi$ and $\phi_{i+1}=\phi_i\sm \{a\}{\times}B$ where

\ceq{\hfill B}{=}{\big\{b\ : \neg\E b'\,\phi(\U,b)\simdiff\phi(\U,b')=\{a\}\big\}}

 the pair $\{a\}{\times}B\subseteq\phi_i$ is such that


arbitrary subject to the condition that $\neg\E y\ \phi_i(\U,b)\simdiff\phi_i(\U,y)=\{a\}$.
We stop when  $\phi_n$ contains no applicable pair $\<a,b\>$.
Then we set $\psi=\phi_n$.



edges in $\{a\}{\times}V$ for some fixed $a\in\U$.
We define $\psi_a=\phi \sm \{a\}{\times} B$, where $B\subseteq\V$ is the largest set such that $\psi_a$ has the property \ssf{\#} above.
The set $B$ is uniquely determined by this requirement, namely

\ceq{\hfill B}{=}{\big\{b\ : \neg\E y\,\phi(\U,b)\simdiff\phi(\U,y)=\{a\}\big\}}














We say that $\psi$ is \emph{honest\/} on $A$ if for every $b$ there is a $b'$ such that
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] $\psi(A,b)=\phi(A,b')$;
\item[2.] $\psi(\U,b)\subseteq\phi(\U,b')$.
\end{itemize}


\begin{proposition} 
If $\psi$ is honest on $A$ then it is honest on all subsets of $A$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Assume that $\psi$ is honest on $A$.
We prove that is honest on $A\sm\{a\}$.
So, fix $b$. 
If $\psi(A,b)=\psi(A\sm\{a\},b)$ the claim is obvious, so assume $\psi(a,b)$.
By minimality, $\psi\sm\{\<a,b\>\}$ does not satisfy \ssf{\#}, then there is $c$ such that $\psi(\U,c)=\psi(\U,b)\sm\{a\}$. As $\psi$ is honest on $A$, there is $b'$ such that 
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] $\psi(A\sm\{a\},b)=\psi(A,c)=\phi(A,b')=\phi(A\sm\{a\},b')$;
\item[2.] $\psi(\U,b)\subseteq\psi(\U,c)\subseteq\phi(\U,b')$.
\end{itemize}
The claim follows.
\end{proof}

This $\psi$ will be constructed by stages.
That is, we define inductively $\phi_0,\dots,\phi_n$.
We let $\phi_0=\phi$ and $\phi_{i+1}=\phi_i\sm\{\<a,b\>\}$ where the pair $\<a,b\>\in\phi_i$ is arbitrary subject to the condition that $\neg\E y\ \phi_i(\U,b)\simdiff\phi_i(\U,y)=\{a\}$.
We stop when  $\phi_n$ contains no applicable pair $\<a,b\>$.
Then we set $\psi=\phi_n$.



edges in $\{a\}{\times}V$ for some fixed $a\in\U$.
We define $\psi_a=\phi \sm \{a\}{\times} B$, where $B\subseteq\V$ is the largest set such that $\psi_a$ has the property \ssf{\#} above.
The set $B$ is uniquely determined by this requirement, namely

\ceq{\hfill B}{=}{\big\{b\ : \neg\E y\,\phi(\U,b)\simdiff\phi(\U,y)=\{a\}\big\}}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop_shift_shatter}
If $A$ is shattered by $\psi_a$ then $A$ is also shattered by $\phi$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We may assume that $a\in A$.
We prove that for every $b$ here is a $b'$ such that $\psi_a(A,b)=\phi(A,b')$.
If $\psi_a(a,b)$ then we may chose $b=b'$.
So, assume $\neg\psi_a(a,b)$.
As $\psi_a$ shatters $A$ then there is $b'$ such that $\psi_a(A,b')=\psi_a(A,b)\cup\{a\}$.
Then $\E y\,\phi(\U,b')\simdiff\phi(\U,y)=\{a\}$.
Therefore $\psi_a(A,b)=\phi(a,y)$.
\end{proof}

Let $\psi_{a_1,\dots,a_n}=(\psi_{a_1,\dots,a_{n-1}})_{a_n}$.

\begin{void_thm}[Second version of second proof of Pajor's Lemma]\label{proof3_Pajor}\rm
As $\Phi=\phi(\U,b)_{b\in\V}$ is finite we can assume $\U$ is finite.
Let $\psi=\psi_{a_1,\dots,a_n}$.
From the discussion above it is clear that the $\psi$-definable sets and the $\phi$-definable sets are equinumerous.
Moreover they shatter the same sets.
We claim that $\psi$ shatters all $\psi$-definable sets.
So the proposition follows from the claim.
If the claim fails, there is a $b$ such that $\psi(\U,b)\sm\{a\}\notin\Psi$.
But this is not possible.\QED
\end{void_thm}
